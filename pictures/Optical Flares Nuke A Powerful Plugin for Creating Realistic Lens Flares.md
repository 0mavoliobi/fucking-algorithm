## Features of Optical Flares Nuke
 
Optical Flares Nuke is based on the popular Optical Flares plugin for After Effects by Video Copilot. It offers many of the same features as the AE version, but with some differences and enhancements for Nuke users. Some of the features include:
 
- **Custom Lens Flare Editor:** You can create your own lens flares from scratch or edit the included presets using a graphical user interface. You can adjust the position, scale, rotation, color, brightness, and blending mode of each flare element, as well as add dynamic animations and behaviors.
- **On Lens Dirt & Real Textures:** You can add realistic imperfections and dust to your lens flares using the included photographic textures or your own custom images. You can also use textures to create custom shapes and patterns for your flares.
- **Visual Preset Library:** You can browse and apply over 100 lens flare presets that are organized by categories such as cinematic, natural, sci-fi, and more. You can also save and share your own presets with other users.
- **Dynamic Edge Animations:** You can create realistic edge effects for your lens flares such as flicker, streak, glow, and iris. You can also control how the flares react to the edge of the screen or mask.
- **Chromatic Aberration:** You can add realistic color distortion and fringing to your lens flares to simulate the optical characteristics of real lenses.
- **3D Lens Flares from Nuke Lights and Geometry:** You can link your lens flares to Nuke's 3D lights and geometry to create true 3D flares that interact with your scene. You can also use Nuke's 3D occlusion features to hide or reveal your flares based on the depth of your scene.
